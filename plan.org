*** Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
*** Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
*** Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
*** Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
*** Working software is the principal measure of progress
*** Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
*** Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
*** Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
*** Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
*** Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

* When will you recommend UP versus Agile Development? Explain why.
* Is there any difference if you are looking at ”The System Lifecycle”
  and the requirements for maintainability and Non Functional
  Requirements (e.g. FURPS+ see next page)?
