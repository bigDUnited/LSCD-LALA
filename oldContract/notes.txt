* Rework logical data model(now it's a domain model).
* Logical model includes specific vehicle types.
* separate ticket and reservation.
* don't include users and clients from the start.
* full set of use case *diagrams*.
* user has to select time, vehicle type...
* one thing should complete the other.
* define important concepts in a file(Reservation etc.).
* DON'T USE FUCKING ENTITY CLASSES. Use only DTOs.
* Keep DTOs shallow.
