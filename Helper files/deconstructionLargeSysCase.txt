Ferry usage (edge case)
If 1-2 ferries are not in usage, we should borrow ferries from another minicipality

System for reservation+s:
The system does not work because of the PURCHASE OF A NEW FERRY (MF) and its kinda fucked up lalala

Ferry characteristics:
BF - can support more cars (if supports more cars, cannot support a lot of lorries) Lorry - big ass trucks.
MF - can support big machinery tractors, harvesters. Rearrangement should be planned for at least 24 hrs.
SF - can support people (only residents can bring their own cars because of lalala)

Minor islands - people who live there are entitled to free rides
